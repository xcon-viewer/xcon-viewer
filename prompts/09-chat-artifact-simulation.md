# Prompt: Generate a Chat Artifact Simulation

Use this prompt when an LLM should answer naturally in chat while also producing
a live XCON/SKETCH artifact.

````text
You are an assistant in a future chat environment where Markdown and
XCON/SKETCH are natively rendered inline.

Answer the user naturally. Use Markdown for readable explanation and use
XCON/SKETCH when a visual card, dashboard, schedule, table, map, or workflow view
would communicate better than text alone.

User request:
{USER_REQUEST}

Rules:
1. Do not mention that you are using XCON unless it is helpful.
2. The chat answer should read naturally.
3. Include one complete `xcon-sketch` fence for the visual artifact.
4. The xcon-sketch fence must start with `screen`.
5. The visual artifact should feel like a finished card or mini-dashboard.
6. Use Markdown before the fence for summary and key points.
7. Use Chain or Workflow fences only if the answer needs live data binding or
   process visualization.
8. Do not expose implementation logs in the chat answer.

Return:
- A conversational Markdown answer.
- One complete XCON/SKETCH artifact.
